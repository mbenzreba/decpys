# Scripts

I work in PowerShell, so the scripts here are the ones I use to generate Sphinx documentation
as well as run PyTest (see the comment in (pytest.ps1)[./pytest.ps1] for why Qt widgets and
GUI functionality can;t be tested normally using `pytest`).

Note that the scripts here need to be executed from the top-level of the `decpys` project folder.
