Welcome to decpys's documentation!
==================================

``decpys`` (or **Dec** -larative **PyS** -ide) is a Python library that acts as a thin wrapper around
the original `PySide6 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/>`_ to enable super-fast GUI prototyping
using modern declarative UI techniques completely within Python. ``decpys`` is licensed under GPLv2.

Jump down to :ref:`some examples <Usage>` to see how ``decpys`` is used.

Examples and Usage
------------------

``decpys`` offers a declarative-flavoured take on the popular Qt UI widget toolkit. Every widget
module in ``decpys`` offers a Qt widget class as well as a one or more top-level functions that
can be used to build logical UI completely within Python.

TODO: Show an example!
