==================================

``decpys`` (or **Dec** -larative **PyS** -ide) is a Python library that acts as a thin wrapper around
the original `PySide6 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/>`_ to enable super-fast GUI prototyping
using modern declarative UI techniques completely within Python. ``decpys`` is licensed under GPLv2.
