# Declarative PySide6

`decpys` (or **Dec**-larative **PyS**-ide) is a Python library that acts as a thin wrapper around
the original [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) to enable super-fast GUI prototyping
using modern declarative UI techniques completely within Python. `decpys` is licensed under
